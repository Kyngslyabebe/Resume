  <p><h5>Causes of Poverty</h5>
<p>Leaders around the world have said so much about the eradication of poverty but understanding the causes of poverty will be the number one step in solving the monstrous problem. First, unemployment is adjudged to be the most common cause of poverty. A country with a high unemployment rate will certainly have a vast majority of its population struggling to be gainfully employed; therefore, its citizens will be unable to afford basic needs such as accommodation, feeding, transportation, and healthcare. The second cause of poverty is civil unrest. A crisis in any country triggers economic uncertainties such as inflation, loss of investorsâ€™ confidence, and massive job loss. These unpleasant economic situations will not only throw people into poverty but have them fleeing for their lives accordingly. Another cause of poverty is lack of education. This means people will not be able to gain meaningful employment, earn decent wages, better align themselves for any political positions and advocate social justice issues for their communities. Good education does not only ensure employability but is a ticket to the decision table as people will be able to pull themselves out of poverty if they are informed and educated. In conclusion, poverty is a negative government performance indicator, and its effects on people cannot be overemphasized; therefore, the government must do all it can to promote policies that will address unemployment, lack of education, and prevent issues that can incite any form of civil unrest.
